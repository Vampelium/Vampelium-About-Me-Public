## Backend & API Self-Hosting (In Progress)

I'm currently working on adding backend and API modules so you can host your own services. This will allow:

- Full control over your data and endpoints
- Easy integration with your own infrastructure
- Example code and setup instructions for Node.js/JavaScript

Stay tuned for updates! All API URLs in the HTML files use example endpoints for now. Replace these with your own backend URLs when the modules are released.

**Coming soon:** Custom host support for backend and APIs will be available for easy integration and deployment.
